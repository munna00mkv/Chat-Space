# Genu-Valgum-Detection
## What is Genu Valgum ?
Genu valgum, commonly called "knock-knee", is a condition in which the knees angle in and touch each other when the legs are straightened. Individuals with severe valgus deformities are typically unable to touch their feet together while simultaneously straightening the legs.
The condition usually becomes apparent when a child is 2 to 3 years old, and it may increase in severity until about age 4. It usually self-corrects by the time a child is about 7 or 8 years old.

### What causes this condition?
injury to or infection in your knee or leg.
bone malformation from rickets, a disease caused by lack of vitamin D and calcium.
other bone diseases.
obesity, which puts extra pressure on your knees.
arthritis in your knee joints.
### How it can be treated?
Treatment for genu valgum depends on the cause and severity of your symptoms.For example, if rickets are causing your knock-knees, your doctor will likely prescribe vitamin D and calcium supplements to help restore your levels.
